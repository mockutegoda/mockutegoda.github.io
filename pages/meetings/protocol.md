## Here is meeting protocol
Meeting objectives:

We should use meetings for rapid communication and clarifications, brainstorming, and group decisions.
We should avoid wasting time on meetings for other matters.
Meeting rules:

Before meeting
Meeting cards should be based on the topic template card in Trello.
Meeting pre-work is assigned by adding a member to the card.
The topics should be prepped in advance. Preparation includes:
Deconstructing the topic into clear objectives.
Framing the objectives as straightforward questions. (See examples below)
If relevant, suggest decision variables. (See examples below)
Determine what data attendees must prepare for the meeting. Request data (See directions below)
Add source material to Google Drive. (See directions below)
Meeting material must be read in advance.

Note not all topics fit into this template. Use with care, but be tidy.


During meeting
Everyone needs to be on time. E.g., 20:00 CEST, sharp.
One topic is being discussed at a time.
The person who prepared the topic leads the conversation.
The topic is not changed before a conclusion has been reached.
More to come...

Source material directions:

Create a folder for the topic in google drive. -> StartUp/Meeting_docs/new_topic. Avoid duplicates!
Determine what source material is relevant for the meeting. Then:
Determine if attendees need to read some of the material; if so, add a reading list. Add the names of the people who should read the content in the 'reading list' checklist.
Distill the information and avoid information overload.
Create a reading list.
Add all source material to the docs.
Link the folder to the topic card in Trello.

Clear questions examples:
Unclear question: What are your dreams?
Semi-clear questions: What do you want to achieve in 6 months?
Clear question: Do you want to push an MVP to market within 6 months?

Decision variables:
Datapoints/variables that we need to answer important questions. A formal example would be:
bool x = has an MVP been identified?
You don't have to frame it like an equation.

Requesting data:
Specify - clearly - what data needs to be prepared. Then request this data from the person that is the most able to retrieve it.
E.g. 'Can all four of us stay in Norway?' is a clear question. This question should be directed at me.

This is done in the following way:
Open the meeting card
Go to the checklist called 'Uncertainty factors and needed data'
Add the question.
Add the person who needs to supply the data to the question.
